    "## Getting Started\n",
    "In this project, you will evaluate the performance and predictive power of a model that has been trained and tested on data collected from homes in suburbs of Boston, Massachusetts. A model trained on this data that is seen as a *good fit* could then be used to make certain predictions about a home — in particular, its monetary value. This model would prove to be invaluable for someone like a real estate agent who could make use of such information on a daily basis.\n",

    "The dataset for this project originates from the [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Housing). The Boston housing data was collected in 1978 and each of the 506 entries represent aggregated data about 14 features for homes from various suburbs in Boston, Massachusetts. For the purposes of this project, the following preprocessing steps have been made to the dataset:\n",
    "- 16 data points have an `'MEDV'` value of 50.0. These data points likely contain **missing or censored values** and have been removed.\n",
    "- 1 data point has an `'RM'` value of 8.78. This data point can be considered an **outlier** and has been removed.\n",
    "- The features `'RM'`, `'LSTAT'`, `'PTRATIO'`, and `'MEDV'` are essential. The remaining **non-relevant features** have been excluded.\n",
    "- The feature `'MEDV'` has been **multiplicatively scaled** to account for 35 years of market inflation.\n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "1. An *increase* in the value of \"RM\" should lead to an *increase* in the value of \"MEDV\" (& vice versa). Because we can look at real world examples to develop a general idea that higher number of rooms usually increases the price of that house as it is possible that with each extra room, an attached washrrom is also there and it can also lead to an increase in the house area.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. An *increase* in the value of \"LSTAT\" should lead to a *decrease* in the value of 'MEDV' (& vice versa). As we are aware of the \"Posh\" areas or the upper-class areas/sectors in a city, so we know that such posh areas are generally costly and only the elite class can afford these places not the poor ones. Thus, we can easliy assume that if percent of lower class workers increase in a locality then it is more likely for that locality to price low (as compared to posh areas). \n",
    "\n",
    "3. An *increase* in the value of \"PTRATIO\" should lead to a *decrease* in the value of 'MEDV' (& vice versa). Due to the reason that if the value of PTRATIO increases it leads to a decrease in the number of teachers available per student in that area (which can be due to less number of schools present in that locality or any other reason) and this can decrease the house prices as the parents might think that buying a property in such a locality can limit their child's exposure and learning."

    "It is difficult to measure the quality of a given model without quantifying its performance over training and testing. This is typically done using some type of performance metric, whether it is through calculating some type of error, the goodness of fit, or some other useful measurement.

Any value between 0 and 1 indicates what percentage of the target variable, using this model, can be explained by the **features**. _A model can be given a negative R<sup>2</sup> as well, which indicates that the model is **arbitrarily worse** than one that always predicts the mean of the target variable._\n",

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The second graph has the maximum depth = 3 for the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The training curve and the testing curve converges to 0.8.\n",
    "    \n",
    "     Initially the **training curve** parabolically decreases upto some level (due to less number of points to fit) as the training points are increased but after some level it lessens its decreasing rate ss more training points are added.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Initially the training error will be less as the model will perform well on less number of points, which leads to higher training score (as it is inverse of the training error).\n",
    "    - As we gradually increase the training points, the training errror will be rising as we have more points to fit which will decrease the training score.\n",
    "    - So, after a while as more and more points are added the training score will start decreasing at a slower rate as comapred to before as the model had now more number of points to fit as before.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The **testing curve** parabolically increases as more and more training points are added.\n",
    "\n",
    "    - Initially, when the number of training points are less, the testing score is also less because there are less number of points to fit in which increases the testing error and hence, the testing score decreases.\n",
    "    - As more training points are added the model gets more points to fit in and thus, it performs better than before. This leads to an increase in the testing score (as the testing error decreases). This makes the testing curve parabolically increase as more training points are added.\n",
    "    - After a while, this increasing rate of the testing curve decrease as comapred to before. \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Having more training points benefit the model but upto some point (threshold) but not after that.\n",
    "    - As in this case, we can visualize that adding training points after 300 makes no alteration to the curves. There is no point adding more data after that as it seems to remain constant after that.\n",
    "    - But before # 300 training points, we can see that it makes a significant difference as we keep on adding more and more training points to our model."

    "### Complexity Curves\n",
    "The following code cell produces a graph for a decision tree model that has been trained and validated on the training data using different maximum depths. The graph produces two complexity curves — one for training and one for validation. Similar to the **learning curves**, the shaded regions of both the complexity curves denote the uncertainty in those curves, and the model is scored on both the training and validation sets using the `performance_metric` function.  \n",

    "### Question 5 - Bias-Variance Tradeoff\n",
    "* When the model is trained with a maximum depth of 1, does the model suffer from high bias or from high variance? \n",
    "* How about when the model is trained with a maximum depth of 10? What visual cues in the graph justify your conclusions?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hint:** High bias is a sign of underfitting(model is not complex enough to pick up the nuances in the data) and high variance is a sign of overfitting(model is by-hearting the data and cannot generalize well). Think about which model(depth 1 or 10) aligns with which part of the tradeoff."

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the curve,\n",
    "\n",
    "1. At max_depth = 1, the model suffers from **high bias** as the model *underfits* due to the reason that it oversimplifies the problem and ends up having a high training as well as high validation error, which leads to a low training score (0.45 approx.) and a low validation score (0.4).\n",
    "    - This is the case of underfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. At max_depth = 10, the model suffers from **high variance** as it over complicates the problem and ends up memorizing it. Thus, leading to a low training error (and a high training score of 0.99 approx. as depicted on the complexity graph). Also, the model will have a high testing error and a low testing score (0.70 approx.).\n",
    "    - This is the case of *Overfitting*.\n",
    "    - That is why, we can visualize from the graph that there is a large difference between the training score and the validation score. \n",
    "    - On memorizing, the mdoel is not able to generalize well on the validation data and hence, ends up approximating badly on teh validation data leading to a high validation error."

    "* What intuition lead you to this answer?\n",
    "\n",
    "** Hint: ** Look at the graph above Question 5 and see where the validation scores lie for the various depths that have been assigned to the model. Does it get better with increased depth? At what point do we get our best validation score without overcomplicating our model? And remember, Occams Razor states \"Among competing hypotheses, the one with the fewest assumptions should be selected.\""

    "**Answer: **\n",
    "\n",
    "1. According to me, the **max_depth** of **3** results in a model that *best* generalizes to unseen data.\n",
    "2. As we can see from the model complexity graph that at max_depth = 3 the validation score (0.75 approx.) is reasonably high as compared to when at other max_depths. Also, the training score (0.8) seems to be well measured at this depth as it is not too high which will make this model do reasonably well on the unseen data. So, both the training score and the validation score are reasonably close enough (*converge*).\n",

    "K-fold cross validation technique helps us to : - \n",
    "    - Break our data into 'k' buckets (parts/groups).\n",
    "    - Then, we train our model 'k' - times.\n",
    "        - Each time, different bucket as our testing set and the remaining points as our training set.\n",
    "        - Always recommended to randomize our data.\n",

    "    - Then, we average the results to get a final model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This technique helps us to not **lose** the training data. We can recycle our training data using k-fold cross validation. (Otherwise, we are just dividing our data into 2 sets - testing and training sets, by doing which we seem to be throwing lot of data away that can be useful in training our algorithm.). This property of k-fold cross validation further helps us in performing Grid Search as we are picking up the best values after training and validating the model several (k) times along with randomization.\n",
    "\n",
    "When picking up the best value for **hyperparameters** for models, such as the C or kernel value for an SVM, there is still a risk of overfitting on the test set because the parameters can be *tweaked* until the model performs optimally. This way, knowledge about the test set can “leak” into the model (hence, breaking our **Golden Rule**) and evaluation metrics (like accuracy, precision, f1 score, regression metrics, etc.) can no longer report on generalizing performance. To solve this problem, we can use a “validation set”: training data is used for training the model, after which evaluation is done on the validation set by calculating the evaluation metrics, and when the experiment seems to be successful, final evaluation can be done on the test set."

    "Your final implementation requires that you bring everything together and train a model using the **decision tree algorithm**. To ensure that you are producing an optimized model, you will train the model using the grid search technique to optimize the `'max_depth'` parameter for the decision tree. The `'max_depth'` parameter can be thought of as how many questions the decision tree algorithm is allowed to ask about the data before making a prediction. Decision trees are part of a class of algorithms called *supervised learning algorithms*.\n",

While it is not the K-Fold cross-validation technique you describe in **Question 8**, this type of cross-validation technique is just as useful!. The `ShuffleSplit()` implementation below will create 10 (`'n_splits'`) shuffled sets, and for each shuffle, 20% (`'test_size'`) of the data will be used as the *validation set*. While you're working on your implementation, think about the contrasts and similarities it has to the K-fold cross-validation technique.\n",

Sometimes, a model could use a learning algorithm that is not appropriate for the structure of the data given. Other times, the data itself could be too noisy or contain too few samples to allow a model to adequately capture the target variable — i.e., the model is underfitted. \n",

    "- How relevant today is data that was collected from 1978? How important is inflation?\n",
    "- Are the features present in the data sufficient to describe a home? Do you think factors like quality of apppliances in the home, square feet of the plot area, presence of pool or not etc should factor in?\n",

    "Well, according to me, the constructed model should not be used in a real-world setting.\n",
    "\n",
    "`Reasons`: -\n",
    "- Firstly, the dataset is many years old. And the prices would have risen during the time period. Hence, **Inflation** is a very important feature affecting the city house prices and thus, should be included in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Secondly, there are many more features which acts as factors to describe a house. For instance, number of floors in the house, the garden area and the open space, the garage size, in which condition the house?, when was the last time it was renovated, etc. And many more. All these factors can act as very crucial features in the pricing of a house.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Also, the range in prices in the code snippet above implies that for any particular client the model's prediction can fall in the range of *\\$69,044.61 *, which lowers the model's robustness as *\\$69k* could be a very huge amount for some people, who are not so financially stable.(but such a price can also be negligible for the elite class and doesn't really negatively affects them.). So, the variation in the predicted values should be decreased.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As we know that the country prices are usually lower as compared to the urban city house prices. So, if the dataset belongs to the urban city then we cannot use to predict the house prices in the country and *vice versa*. Thus, the model cannot be used for a whole city.\n",
    "\n",
    "- For example: if a house is not renovated since a long time or if the house is not maintained well by a family, it's house price should definitely **not** have an impact on the neighborhood prices. So, such instances should be singled out from the dataset so as to nullify their effect on the neighborhood house pricing. \n",
    "\n",
    "**So, if we are able to collect more new data and if possible the inflation rates over time then may be it is possible to deliver a more robust model than this one.**"
